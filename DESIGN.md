# Why and what technologies were used?

I used Bootstrap v5 because it makes development faster. 

At some point I wanted to style Bootstrap's components so I installed [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) which are required for Bootstrap's customization.

Imported Bootstrap components are found in `scss/custom.scss`.

Sass is compiled in the `styles.css` file. 

PHP is used for the server side.
