# Why and what technologies were used?

I used Bootstrap v5 because it makes development faster. 

At some point I wanted to style Bootstrap's components so I installed [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) which are required for Bootstrap's customization.

In my scss/custom.scss, I imported the Bootstrap's components I wanted to style and wrote some other css which doesn't have to do with Bootstrap. 

Sass is compiled in the styles.css file.
